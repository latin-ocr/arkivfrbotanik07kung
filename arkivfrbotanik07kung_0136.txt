maica plants that VVikstrom has written ›>Herb. Solandri ex
Herbario Linnaei›> or »Ex Herb. Linnaeano accepit Solander».
As 10 how Solander's herbarium got 10 the Natural History
Museum, only this much is known that a number of these
plants belong to the large Herb. 0355110111, which was left
by its owner S. N. CAssTRoM (1763—1827) to the K. Veten-
skapsakademien.1

It is possible that Linne fil. took over these plants from
Solander‚ who died in London in 1782 during Linne filzs’
stay there.

Solander’s herbs are as a rule very reliably classified.
Some of 1110111 have no classification‚ because they had not
yet been described by Linnaeus In some cases the name of
the species has been inserted at a later period in the
handwriting of Linne fil. (It is already said that
Linne' pater has written the namo in some of the sheets).
‘lt may therefore be assumed that a number of Solander's
plants remained after his departure in Linnaeus’s herbarium
or at least in »ΗΕ-,1110110111 parvum» (see above, p„ 5).

It merel-v remains to be mentioned that a small number
of plants‚ some from Linne, some from Hort. Ups., seem to
carry LoFLINGs and OSBECK’S handwritings. Similarly a few
Linnaean plants are met with in Herb. Casstrom. The an—
notations in Linnaeus’s hand which are found on the sheets
have been certified by Casstrom with the following written
words: »Auloqraphon divi Linnoei».
