Montin is however most eloquent in his professions of friend—
ship in connection with Lofling’s name. He kept up a very
lively correspondence with the latter during the few years.
(1751ffl1753) he spent in Spain. In a letter to Montin Los-
ling mentioned the »order of rank» in which he arranged his
Spanish plants, viz. l) Lofling, 2) Linnaeus‚ 3) Montin‚ 4)
Gyllenborg, 5) Back‚ 6) Kalm‚ 7) Holm, 8) Liidbeck, 9) Wahl-
bom.¹ Lofling who was an uncommonly lovable young man
and a faithful friend⁷ writes to Montin in terms of great
warmth and heartiness of affection. »May the Lord our God
bless you with a joyful new year. May he let- you this year
reap the fruit your industry and toil has earned.» Montin
on the. other hand in the case of every plant which Lofling
has sent mentions his friend with much circumstance and ar
great variety of different formulae, e. g. »Plantam hanc misit
D2nus P. Lofling, Szae Cathol. Maj. Botanicus clarissimus, ut
collectanea mea ornaret»; »Specimen ad Madritum lectum
misit B. M. D:nus P. Loefling, 8:ae Cathol. Majzs Botanicus
olim indefessus» etc. In the case of Loeslinqia hispanica-
Montin writes: »Habitat in Hispaniae collibus apricis, Specimen
indeque misit Szae Cathol. Majztis Botanicus Celeb. dum
vixit Dznus Petrus Loefling, quod in signum intimae et infu-
catae inter nos amicitiae suique dignissimam commemorationem
a me sancte servari voluit, praesertim quum ejus nomen novo·
huic generi imposuit Nob. Succorum Professor, Archiater et
Eques de Stella polari D2nus Carolus a Linne, ut posteritati
notum faceret, quantum periculosis itineribus, longis pere-
grinationibus et indefesso labore de Republica literaria. im·
primis Scientiae Naturalis cultoribus promeruit noster Loef—
ling.» To this Montin has added a very long and circum-⁷
stantial bi‹r›graphy of Lofling.

A great number of plants in the Herb. Montin (several
hundreds) conio from the Hortus Upsaliensis and almost all
of these are stated to have been sent by the »hortulanus
Nietzcl». who was employed at Upsala botanical garden from
1739 to 1756, accordingly during Linnaeus’s lifetime; a few of
these however have been sent from the garden by Linnaeus,.
some also by Linnaeus's pupils, e. g. Lindwall (they must
