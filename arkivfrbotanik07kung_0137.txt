C. A. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. 17

science. The following list shows that many genera are very
well represented here, and in some cases all the species of a
Linnaean genus arc kept in this herbarium. l'n many cases
it is sufficient to quote the name of the species according to
Linnaeus (and Linne fil.); but in some cases it is necessary as
far as possible to add a new classification according to our
present views of certain dubious species or series abound-
ing in forms. Part of this work has been done by post-
linnaean notes on the plant-sheets, mostly by J. E. Wikstrom
and S. N. Casstrom. Some few have besides been treated
by specialists in ‘the middle of the 19th century along with
the other herbarium material of oldest date: thus e. g.
some Urt‘z'caceoe have been classified by Weddell, some Sper-
9ulariae by Kindberg, some Euphorbiaceae by Miiller Arg.
(1863). some few Pteridophyta by Baker etc. But it still
remains to subject these plants to comparative investiga-
tions, especially in the cases where distinct plants have re-
ceived the same name from Linnaeus, although they may evi-
dently be reckoned as separato species. Sometimes the cipher
given by Linnaeus is certainly without importance for the
knowledge of the species in its genus and accordingly quite
misleading. A circumstance which is of valuable aid in the
classification is that Linnaeus's own often insignificant and
badly damaged specimen is completed by a large and very
well preserved specimen from Hortus Upsaliensis (through
Nietzel) in Montin’s herbarium. As accordingly these Lin-
naean plants deserve a critical investigation which might re-
quire a good deal of time in order to make out if the speci-
men really belongs to the said species, or any confusion
has been made by Linnaeus, for the present only the begin-
ning of the list i. e. as far as Tem-andria is published here,
and the rest will be given in a future pamphlet.

In the list now following, which in its order answers in
the main to Syst. Veg. ed. 13 (1774) and Suppl. plant. (1781),
will be found for every species firstly its name, and as far
as possible the name of the species in Linnaeus‚ next (in
italice) a citation of the words or signs which Linnaeus and
