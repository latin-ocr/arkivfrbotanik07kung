a very large part of the botanical collection of the Natural
History Museum from the l8th century.l

For his assistant and superintendent of his museum Al-
stromer had the zealous botanist ANDERS DAHL (1751-1789),
who during the last years of Linnaeus’s life had been his pupil
and visitor in his house. Dahl has on every sheet in the
Herbar. Alstromer noted with great aceuracy, from whom
the plant was obtained, and in the cases When he himself
received a plant, he has also made a note of it. We thus
find, that· he himself received a very considerable number of
plants 1) from Linne (»Dahl a Linne P.>›)‚ 2) from Linne fil.
(»Dahl a Linne f.»)‚ 3) from Hortus Upsaliensis while Lin-
naeus was still alive and during the years immediately after
his death.'-’

The greater part of these plants are furnished besides
with names or other inscription by Linnaeus himself, as we
see from his peculiar handwriting (and precisely in the same
way as the plants above mentioned out of the herbarium of
Linne fil„ see above). Their genuine origin direct from
Linnaeus is besides recognizable by certain peculiarities in
the arrangement which are characteristic of Linnaeus’s great
herbarium. In his autograph memoirs of himself3 Linne has
made the following statement as to his herbarium: »Det {ir
lagdt i ordning efter genera, species och classes med utantill
paskrifne nomina specifica . . . Alla dessa vaxter har jag in-
klistrade med ichthyocolla} hvart species pa ett sarskildt
halft ark pappen och alla halfark, som hora till samma genus,
hai· jag inlagcl‹;= i ett helt pappersark, pa hvilket jag skrifvit
namnet af genus och pii halfarket namnet af species . .. Sa
simpel arrangering har icke blifvit patankt forut».5
