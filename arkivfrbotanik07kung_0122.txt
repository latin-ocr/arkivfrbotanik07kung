or other docketing in his own hand ; secondly of such plants
as others received from Linnaeus, in the majority of cases of
quite certain authenticity, and often with a· reference by
the recipient to one of Linnaeus's phytographic works, finally
of such as were distributed from »Hortus Upsaliensism either
by Linnaeus himself or by the gardeners there. It hardly
requires to be pointed out, that the plants distributed from
»Hortus Upsaliensis», where they grew up under Linnaeus's
immediate superintendence and classified by him, may have
just the same importance as his herbarium speoimens, when
it is a question of deciding what he meant by a name or a
description, and besides these plants thus cultivated possess
a special interest of their own as a contribution to the history
of that garden which was so famous in Linnaeus's lifetime.
The herbaria, by which the Linnaean plants now in question
found their way to the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stock-
holm (formerly K. Vetenskaps-Akademiens Naturaliesamling),

are as follows:

The.. herbarium of Carl von Linne fil.

Linnaeus’s son Carl at the early age of 18 was appointed
demonstrator in the botanical garden of Uppsala (1759),
and in 1763 as his father’s substitute with the promise of
being appointedv his successor. During his father’s last long
illness which incapacitated him for his office, his son was
installed as professor in 1777. Although his father expressly
states that his son did not shew any predilection for botany
and did not help him in the collection and care of the great
herbarium, it is nevertheless clear that the son in the dis-
charge of his duties must have collected and preserved a
certain number of plants out of the garden and assisted his
father in labelling them eto, and that father and son actu-
ally did work together to some extent, is shewn by the fact
that a great number of plants are found labelled by them
both and many plants which were given as presents by the
father are furnished with names in the handwriting of the
s-on, and vice versa.

Linne fil. also possessed a herbarium of his own, though
rather a small one, when in 1778 he became the owner of
the father-'s great herbarium. This fact is mentioned in a
