Solander’s herbarium.

In the oldest collectione of plants of the State Natural
History Museum a large number of well preserved plants are
to be found pasted on very ‘chin but tough and firm paper.
On a number of these 3116613 has been written (in Casstrom’s
handwriting) at a later period »Ex Herb. beati D. Solanderi»,
and the director of the botanical collections J. E. Wikstrom
has written on a large number of sheets »Herb. Solandri».
All these plants are (apart from the quality of the paper)¹
easily recognizable through the fact that the name of the
genus is written in small elegant capitals on the margin at
the top and the name of the species in the margin at the
bottom, both on the front side; on the back is written in
an even free and beatiful hand the diagnosis and number
etc. in the Species plantarum ed. 1. Α number of these
sheets carry besides a loca] designation »Pitea›>‚ (Solander’s
native town), others ›>Tornoa» (Ἕω-11611), which makes it pro-
babh· that they were collected by Solanden who in 1756
mado a botanical journey through Pite Lappmark and the
adjacmit parts of Norway etc.¹ 1 the year 1760 Solander left

that. (lentiam aurea L. Sp. pl. ed. 2, p. 331, nr 12, is to be found in the.
