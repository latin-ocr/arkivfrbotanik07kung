accordingly have been permitted to collect plants in the aca-
demical garden)‚ or obtained by purchase from persons who
received the plants from Hort. Ups.‚ e. g. med lic. Hall, Sal-
berg, Salomon, and others. As to the gardener Nietzel, it
may reasonably be asked how he could dispense with such
a large number of herbs, and such numerous and fine speci—
mens of them. Whether this took place with the permission
of the. director is a question which must remain unanswered.
The probability is that Montin compensated Linnaeus in Swedish
(and foreignss) plants, especially living plants for the garden.
In a letter from Lofling (1761) we read that Montin likewise
sent plants (in exchangeZ) to Jussieu.

Finally it should be mentioned with regard to Herb.
Montin., that a number of plantS, but not a very considerable
one, were received from Linnaeus in person, e. g. »Donum
Nobil. Arch. et Equit. Dzni a Linne›>; »Specimen misit Nobil.
Arch. et Equ. de Stella bor. D1nus a Linne'›>; ›>Faventer. . .
Linne hoc specimen communicavit», likewise some from Linne
fil.: »Specimcn novae speciei ex Horto Ups. misit D:nus Caro—
lus von Linne‘ 1779», etc. etc.

tions to it.
