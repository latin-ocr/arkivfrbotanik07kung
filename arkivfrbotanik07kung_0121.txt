C. Α. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. 3

Delima, and he shall have 10 others quite as rare as 11115,
for my specimen is without fruit, which 1115 has».

Even from the comparatively small haul which Linnaeus
brought home from his J'ourney in Lappland in 17:32 he gave
specimens to Prof. J. BURMAN of Anistcrdam.¹

In the botanical department of the Naturhistoriska Riks-
museet (Stockholm) the author has during the last two years
looked for plants from Linne and has succeeded in collecting
a considerable number. They have been found for the most
part amongst bundles of plants and in cases from old times
(the latter part of the 18th century). which in the course of
years (presumably about 1860) had been packed away in
lumbenrooms, owing to want of space, and were of course
bound to suffer injury from (11151, 5001, damu and insects.
Thanks however 10 1110 indestructable paper and the old
method of gluing the whole plant fast, these old specimens
are comparatively well preserved, and many plants look as
if they had been quite recently prepared.

These are precious treasures from the great epoch 01 our
natural history, which are thus again brought to light. Lin-
naeus himself has laid stress on the importance 01 possessing
material which might serve as a control in case a fresh in-
vestigation should be required, and especially with regard to
his own plants and original specimens 1101135 uttered the
following words: »Ovarderliga i sig sjalfva, med tiden mer
och mer begarliga›>.² He clearly realized that his life and
activity had been intimately bound up with the whole future
development 01 botany. His collections are still in demand
and are eonstantly being consulted not merely as relics from
the time when the »princeps botanicorum» himself was living
in the realm of Flora, but 35 1110 111051 reliable aid to the
study of his writings and as being as it were answers out of
his own mouth to vexed botanical questions.

The collection of plants, which has thus been designated
by the name »Linnaean herbarium», consists firstly of plants
which Linnaeus himself possessed and furnished with names
