8 ARKIV F6R Bo'rANIK. BAND 7. N:O 3.

It is evident that, during his daily association with Lin-
naeus, Dahl reeeived firstly duplicate sheets from his herbarium
(With or without notes in Linnaeus’s handwriting)‚ secondly

loose plants which Dahl himself pasted and furnished with
names after Linnaeus’s directions.1

It is not ineoneeivable that Clas Alstromer received for
his herbarium a number of planta direct from Linnaeus’s own
hand (and after his death from Linne fii). Among these ean
be reekoned all those which (without other specification) are·
marked 'in Dahl’s handwriting merely with these words: »a
Linne P». The Herb. Aletromer in fact comprises also planis>
from a great number of other eminent botanists‚ collectors‚
and travellers, among them many who contributed to Lin-
naeus’s great herbarium. Among those‚ who thus (aeoording to
a note of Dahl on the back of the paper, at the bottom,

in the centre) contributed to the Herb. Aleti-omer, may be
named the following.
