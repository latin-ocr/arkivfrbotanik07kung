It is evident from this list, that the Herb. Alstromer re-
ceived contributions from many persons who sent botanical
collections also to Linne according to his autograph memoirs
of himself. It is very probable that a great many specimens
from such botanists first passed through Linnaeus’s hands
before Alstromer received them, but all such plants about
which this is not known for certain, will not be counted here.
(The plants from Dalberg‚ P. Browne and Gmelin however
are all from Linnaeus’s herbarium).

Montin's herbarium.

LARS JOHAN MONTIN (1723—1785) was Linnaeus’s pupil
in Upsala. At his instigation he made a botanical expedition
to Lule Lappmark and the adjoining regions of Norway in
1749. From this journey he brought back a rich collection
of both preserved and living plants. He became »Provincial-
Medicus» in Halmstad and investigated very carefully the
surrounding country for botanical purposeS. (One of his
neighbours was P. OSBECK‚ Linnaeus’s pupss, known for his
successful botanical journey 10 East India and China and
from 1759 vicar and dean of Hasslo'f near Laholm.)

MONTIN'S herbarium is now to be found in its entirety
in the State Natural History Museum in Stockholm, although
unfortunately it had up till now had its place in a lumber-
room.l This herbarium must have been 011οΞ01 the richest
