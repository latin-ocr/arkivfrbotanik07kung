C. A. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEA‘N HERBARIUM. 15

Sweden and went and settled in England. No work of Lin-
naeus’s other than Spec. plant. ed. l (1753) and Centuria l
plantarum (1755) is quoted, not even Spec. plant. ed. 2, even
with reference to named plants which were subsequently pu-
blished in ed. 2 (1763). This makes it probable that the col-
lection belonged to Solander. It is a well-known fact that
at certain pcriods the latter was a daily visitor in Linnaeus's
house and almost spent more time there than in his own
home. Linnaeus regarded him as one of his most gifted
pupils, and in the first two years of his stay in England hc
actually invited him to act as his substitute, in order after-
wards to become his successor. It is beyond all doubt that
Solander worked under Linnaeus’s immediate direction and
so collected a fine herbarium3 and indeed a very large num-
ber of these plants are marked ›>Hort. Ups.» or »Hor-t». lt
is probable that Solander also assisted Linnaeus with his
labelling, which seems to be shewn by the fact that a num-
ber of the plants now in question (in Solander's handwriting)¹
also have some sign of Linnaeus’s, e. g. H. V. (Hert. Ups.)
or the domicile (e. g. India), nay occasionally the name of
the species.

Solander’s intimate relation to Linne is still further con—
firmed by te fact that a very large number of these (Solan—
der's) plants have the inscription marnaio-a, Patr. Browne»,
or merely ›>Jamaica›>. In the year 1758 Linnaeus bought from
the Irishnian Patr. Browne (1720—1790), who had lived for
some time as a doctor in Jamaica, a great herbarium com-
prising more than l,O()O rare plants.2 We thus see, that
Linnaens parted with some of these plants to Solander before
the latter left Sweden. &Vhen the main part of Browne's
plants —- consisting to a great extent of original specimens
of Linnaeus’s decript-ions —- went back to England with the
Linnaean herbarium, a by no means small number thus hap-
pened to remain in Sweden. It is chiefly on Browne’s Ja-

¹ As Solander was a phlegmatic person and a lazy correspondent,
letters froin him are rare and the author has not yet had a chance oi'
seeing a letter of his. Howevcr, by the kind assistance of Mr. L. Bygden
and ΜΓ, Akscl Andersson, librarians of Upsala University. I have succee-
ded in seeing Solander's handwriting in an old minute-book; Ι found it
perfectly like the specimens on his herbarium sheets.

² According to Limiaeus’s letter to Abr. Biick 18. 7. 1758, when the
plants arrived in Uppsala.
