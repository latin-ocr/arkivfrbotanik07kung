and best arranged in our country in the 18th century. Mon—
tin’s plants are glued on the stoutest and stiffest paper that
one ean find in herbaria of that date, and he has devoted
enormous care to the arrangement, preservation‚ and getup
of the herbarium. No other of the older collectors has sacri-
ficed even approximately so much time and trouble to furnish
his plants with complete annotatione. Labels are not met
with, no more than in other contemporary collections (the
small slips which are occasionally to be seen on Linnaeus’s
herbarium sheets have got into the herbarium from the collec—
tion and often bear merely a number or a provisional classi—
fication⁹ most complete in the case of Kalm‚ Lefling and
Konig). Montin has used only the back of the sheet for his
annotations. Each sheet has not merely complete genus and
species (t-he genus in large and more or less ornate hand—
writing)‚ but also the diagnosis out of Spec. plant. or Syst. nat„
the domicile of the species (area) and the nature of the locality,
and finally information as to the collector, the country of collec—
tion and the person who sent Montin the specimen, and often
also the year.

From these annotations we find that Montin carried on
an amazlingly extensive and regular correspondence with
both Swedish and foreign botanists, collectors, and travellers.
He is one of the most zealous and alert collectors of his time
and has the great merit of having absorbed in his herbarium
very precious collections which were thus safed from destruc-
tion or oblivion.

Montin’s herbarium thus contains a large number of
original spec-imens from e. g. THUNBERG’s tmvels, amounting
to two or three thousand plants and perhaps forming the
greater part of this herbariunu next come the plants sent
