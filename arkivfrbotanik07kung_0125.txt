O. A. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. t

It should however be observed that instead of the name
of the species Linnaeus often writes a number referring to
the number in its genus in »Species plantarum» (usually ed.
l, 1753; occasionally an initial which refers to the new species
in Systema naturae, ed. 10, 1759). According to C. HART-
MAN,l Linnaeus in his great herbarium wrote merely numbers
or ciphers but not names on sheets which may be considered
as duplicares and which lie next to a sheet on which the
name is written. Occasionally a cipher is found in pcncil3
thereby Linnaeus (according to Hartman p. 9) meant to de-
signate merely the number of the plant within its genus in
the plant-case. As 110 genus is given and the species is only
designated with a cipher, it is hard to identify the plant, if
the- specimen is in any way defective. In many cases how-
ever the generic name is also written in a large hand on
the top of the sheet, sometimes in Linnaeus's handwriting‚
sometimes in that of his son. The name and number of the
species on the other hand is often written by Linnaeus with
very small often overlooked signs. The name is written on the
sheet itself. Only in his younger days, to judge by the hand-
writing, did Linnaeus write the names on labels with a
border printed in a pretty decorative rococo pattern. Specimens
from that time moreover have often the picture of a vase
or an urn pasted under them. Even among Dahl’s plants
there are many to be found which show that the father and
son not seldom collaborated‚ for plants with the designation
»Dahl a Linne P.» sometimes have a species name written
in the handwriting of the son, and vice versa. (The hand—
writing of Linne fil. is somewhat larger and more legiblc,
but less neat and pleasing than the father's). Linnaeus has
often added other signs, e. g. K (Kalm), L (Liifling)‚ Monsp.
(Montpellier)‚ H. V. (Hortus Upsaliensis)‚ Lapp. S. (Lapponia‚
Solander), India. Algir(!) etc. etcs2 On the back of the sheet
Linnaeus not unfrequently wrote a longer designation‚ usually
a synonym from CASPAR BAUHTN or others. But a number
of plants which were evidently owned by Linnaeus are quite
undetermined and have indeed never received names from
him, as they are wanting in his writings, and were first
described by VAHL, WILLDENow, LAMARCK, and others.
