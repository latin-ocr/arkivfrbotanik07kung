e. A. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. 11

by Sir JOSEPH BANKs and his assist-ants (probably amounting
also to several thousand sheets). In the same way the Na-
tural History Muscum now possesses several hundred species
from Linnaeus’s most prominent pupiIS, SOLANDER (through
Banks)‚ LoFmNG (from Portugal and Spain), OSBEOK (from
the Cape, India and China), F ORSKi-KHL (sent through Vahl). ——
collections which otherwise are included in Linnaeus's great
herbarium in London and have thus been lost to Sweden.
Amongst· other annotat-jons in Montin’s handwriting we
read scientifice observations and data given by the collector3
about some of them, e. g. those which Montin himself has
described (as e. g. Erica Thunbergii) it is also stated where
the description was published. Resides this on nearly every
sheet there is an acknowledgement or compliment to the
sender of the plant, e. g. »A destructione conservari a. me
voluit celeb. Dmus Prof. Joh. Leche specimen hoc Kalmi-
anum›>; »Specimine hoc auxit collectiones meas Dznus Falck
med. stud.»; »Elegantis speciminis participem me fecit Med.
Licent. Dtnus Carolus Petrus Tliunberg»3 »Specimen misit
Nobil. Dznus BankS, Armiger, 1777›>; »Specimen herbarii
Jacquin misit Generos. Baron. Dtnus Banks 1787›>; »Specimen
ex Japonia per literas misit Exp. D. D. Thunberg anno 1777».
All shows an enthusiasm and collecting zcal which well deserves
to bc noticed and admired, and lcts us see the high value
Montin sets both on science itself and on the scientists per-
sonally. At the same time wc clearly realize what· a high
opinion Montin had of his own well ordered and well cared
for herbarium. ff then the name of the plant gives occasion,
he gives a longer or shorter sketch of the life of the botanist
in question with accurate biographical data. ln the case of
Lechea minor e. g. he. wrote a sketch of Leche’s life (Professor
at Abo, d. 1761). taking up nearly the whole of the back of
the sheet. In the case of Osbeclcia chimensis he wrote a long
biography of Osbeck in which the following passage occurs:
»Natus 1723 in tuguriolo Oset par. Halanda dioec. Gotho-
burg.. . Novum hoc genus inventori, ut de Republica Bota-
nica optime merito, sacrum voluit Dznus Arch. et Eques aurat.
Carolus a Linne, ne omni operum et periculorum fructu plane
destitui videret-ur. . . Collegit enim in insula Java et in China
extra urbem Canton summo labore ultra CCC plantarum spe-
cies, quarum plus quam centum particeps factus sum . . .›> —
