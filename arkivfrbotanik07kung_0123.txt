C. A. M. LINDMAN, Α LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. 5

letter from Prof. J. G. Acmen in Uppsala to J. Ε. SMITH
(feb. 1784).ι Moreover at his death he gave orders that the
former, the so called »Herbarium parvum») (i. c. the plants
he collected in his youth), should not be sold but should be
given 10 the Swedish collector and Maecenas Baron CLAS
ALs'rRoMER, who had in former days advanced him money
for his journey to England in 1781—82.‘-'

Consequently there were incorporated with the HERB. AL—
STRoMER 1) the late Prof. Linne's own herbarium, among
which a great number 01 plants are labelled ›>H. U. 1777»;
2) a great number which 116 received from his father aud
which the latter in his lifetime had furnished with notes and
classifieations3 and it is through the Herb. Alstromer, to
which we will now pass over, that these Linnaean plants
came into the possession 01 1116 Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet.

Among the plants of Linne 111. several were not collected
or obtained until after the death of the father, as e. g. the
collection which Linne 111. acquired from BANKs and others
during his visit to London.

All the plants out 01 1116 herbarium 01 Linne 11]. are
included here, even those whose authentic origin from the
father is dubious; during his short professorship Linne 111.
was in fact occupied with the arrangement and publication
of his father’s scientific remains.

Clas Alstriimer’s herbarium.

Baron CLAs ALSTRCSMER (1736—1794), son 01 the famous
promoter of Swedish industry JONAS ALSTRCJMER‚ was Lin-
naeus's pupil in Uppsala; after leaving the university he made
a journey to Southern Europe (1760—1764), mainly with a
view to natural history. When he returned home he devoted
himself zealously to natural history collections, retired early
from his official career, laid out a botanical garden at Chri-
stinedal near Gothenburg and brought together a very large.
and valuable herbarium. On his death this herbarium was
left to the R.. Academy of science in Stockholm and forms
