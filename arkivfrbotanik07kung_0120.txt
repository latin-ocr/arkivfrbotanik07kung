this precious scientific collection was lost to Sweden, and
that those who brought about the sale have been subject to
reproach. But at the same time we have reason to rejoice
that Linnaeus's herbarium, that »Palladium of seience›>¹ fell
to the magnanimous and generous English nation and came
into the hands of enlightened and noble men, who have
always treated this collection with unparalleled marks of
honour and the most scrupulous care, first Dr. J. E. SMITH
and after his death the Linnaean Society.

then we know the widely diffused interest in natural
history which existed in Sweden in Linnaeus’s days and the
extensive correspondence Linnaeus carried on with the collec-
tors and scientists of his time, we should be led to expect
that a number of plants had been bestowed by Linnaeus on
his friends and disciples and thus remained in Sweden,
when his own herbarium was sold to England. We have
indeed heard from time to time that some small number of
plants from. Linnaeus’s herbarium was to be found in the
possession of now this, now that still surviving person or
institution, to whom they had descended from older times.
Thus e. g. the herbarium belonging to Linnaeus's eminent
disciple Dr. J. G. WAHLBOM (1724—1807) was recovered in
Kahnar in the year 1870„ and amongst it was found a small
collection of plants from Linnaeus's herbarium, which is now
the property of the Botanical Museum of Uppsala University.2
In the Bergian herbarium of Bergielund near Stockholm pre-
sented to the K. Svenska Vetenskapsakademien by Linnaeus's
disoiple, Prof. P. J. BERGIUS (1730-1790), about 30 plants
are to be found classified3 in Linnaeus's handwriting.

That Linnaeus was by no means stingy with his plants
is clearly seen from passages in his letters. Thus e. g. he
writes to the archiater ABR. Bjtcss of Stockholm (1773):
»Ι have kept two plants which are not to be found in my
collecti0n3 in return I have enclosed 20, all capenses, and a>
Zamia from Florida›>; and in the year 1769 he writes: »Gree—
